## Problem Statement
Small-scale handmade craft businesses often struggle with managing inventory, tracking orders, and providing a modern, interactive way to engage with their customers online. Existing platforms charge high fees and lack a personalized touch.

**Limitations:** Payment gateway integration and advanced shipping tracking are currently out of scope and simulated for now.

## Expected Features List
1. User Registration and Login.
2. A browsing catalog of products categorized by type.
3. Administrative panel to Add, Update, or Delete products.
4. "Play and Earn" mini-game for engaging users.
5. Cart system (simulated checkout).
